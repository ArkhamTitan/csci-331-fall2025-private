          This project explores building React components using Next.js. 
          The final project is an outfit recommender that helps users choose clothing based on their preferences
          and occasions. The site will allow users to input their style preferences, weather conditions, or upcoming events,
          and then suggest outfit options accordingly. The plan is to showcase it by collecting user data on their style choices and needs,
          and using that data to generate personalized outfit recommendations.
